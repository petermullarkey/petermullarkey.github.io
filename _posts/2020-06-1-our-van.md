In October of 2019, interested in trying out (non)tent camping, we
rented a Ram Promaster City campervan from [KuKu Campervans](https://www.kukucampers.com/cars/category-ab/)
for a week and had a [great time](https://petermullarkey.github.io/chaco-and-mesaverde). It was just big
enough, well laid out, and built to
last. Based on that experience, we
worked with Magnus and Riley at KuKu Campers to convert the used 2017
Promaster City that we found and bought in Austin, TX.
