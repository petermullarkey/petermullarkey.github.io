**dates:** Friday May 28-29, 2021

**location:** Conchas Lake, NM

**elevation:** ?? feet

**cell coverage:** T-Mobile - very good in camp

**summary:** We enjoyed swimming in the reservior. We needed to head back early to dodge severe thunderstorms and hail (that ended up causing flooding along I-25 in southern Colorado on Sunday - after we were home)

Here is our trusty campervan in our campsite overlooking the reservoir.
